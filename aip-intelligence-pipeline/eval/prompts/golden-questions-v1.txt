You are generating a thesis evaluation “golden question set” for the OpenAIP chatbot. The chatbot can ONLY answer using published AIP data. It supports: (a) line-item facts (amounts PS/MOOE/CO/FE/Total, fund source, schedule dates, implementing agency, expected output, ref-code lookup), (b) totals (Total Investment Program), (c) SQL-first aggregations (top projects, totals by sector, totals by fund source, compare years), and (d) city-level questions using City AIP when available, otherwise it may ask to fallback to barangays-in-city.

TASK
Output EXACTLY 200 questions as JSONL (one JSON object per line). No extra commentary. No markdown. No code fences. Just JSONL.

REQUIRED COUNTS (must be exact)
- 60 city-level questions (scope_mode="city")
- 110 barangay-level questions (scope_mode="barangay")
- 30 cross-scope/global questions (scope_mode="global")
- Inside the 200 total, include 30–40 UNSUPPORTED questions (answerable=false), clearly labeled. The remaining must be supported (answerable=true).

SCOPE ENTITIES (use these names consistently)
City:
- "City of Cabuyao"

Barangays (use these exactly; do NOT invent new barangays):
- "Mamatid"
- "Pulo"
- "San Isidro"
- "Banay-Banay"

Fiscal years:
- Use FY 2022 for city-level questions (City AIP is FY 2022).
- Use FY 2025 and FY 2026 for barangay/global questions.
- For compare-years, use 2025 vs 2026. For city compare-years, use 2022 vs 2023 ONLY if you explicitly mark it as unsupported unless you can ground it (assume only FY 2022 city AIP exists).

SUPPORTED QUESTION TYPES (answerable=true)
1) Line-item fact questions (must include at least one of: amount, fund source, schedule, implementing agency, expected output, ref code)
2) Totals: "Total Investment Program" for a specific FY + scope
3) Aggregations:
   - "Top N projects ..." (N in {3,5,10})
   - "Budget totals by sector ..." (FY optional)
   - "Budget totals by fund source ..." (FY optional)
   - "Compare 2025 vs 2026 total budget ..." (barangay/global only)
4) “Fund sources exist/list/available” queries (list-only) (FY optional)

UNSUPPORTED QUESTION TYPES (answerable=false) — include 30–40 of these
- Contractors/suppliers/winning bidders
- Procurement mode (SVP/bidding), BAC/procurement details
- Exact site address/street/geocoordinates (unless explicitly stated; assume NOT present)
- Beneficiary counts (how many people), KPI/outcome targets, malnutrition reduction targets, etc.
- Monthly/quarterly disbursement schedules, liquidation/actual spending
- Predictions/opinions/accusations/corruption claims
- Any city-level FY other than 2022 (unless phrased as “if available”; still mark unsupported since only FY 2022 exists)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSONL)
Each line must be a valid JSON object with this exact schema:

{
  "id": "Q0001",
  "audience": "citizen" | "lgu_official",
  "scope_mode": "city" | "barangay" | "global",
  "lgu_hint": { "city": "City of Cabuyao" | null, "barangay": "Mamatid"|"Pulo"|"San Isidro"|"Banay-Banay"|null },
  "fiscal_year_hint": 2022 | 2025 | 2026 | null,
  "question": "string",
  "expected": {
    "answerable": true|false,
    "supported_type": "line_item_fact" | "totals" | "aggregate_top_projects" | "aggregate_totals_by_sector" | "aggregate_totals_by_fund_source" | "aggregate_compare_years" | "fund_sources_exist" | "unsupported",
    "target_field": "amount"|"fund_source"|"schedule"|"implementing_agency"|"expected_output"|"total_investment_program"|"sector_totals"|"fund_source_totals"|"compare_years"|"fund_sources_list"|null,
    "expected_status": "answer"|"refusal"|"clarification",
    "expected_refusal_reason": "document_limitation"|"retrieval_failure"|"missing_required_parameter"|"ambiguous_scope"|"unsupported_request"|null
  }
}

RULES FOR expected.*
- If answerable=true: expected_status must be "answer" OR "clarification" (use clarification only when fiscal year is intentionally omitted or scope is intentionally ambiguous).
- If answerable=false: expected_status must be "refusal" and expected_refusal_reason must be one of:
  - "document_limitation" for contractors/procurement/address/beneficiaries/KPIs/disbursement
  - "unsupported_request" for opinions/predictions/accusations
  - "retrieval_failure" ONLY when you ask for a clearly non-existent project title (use sparingly).
- Do NOT use "ambiguous_scope" unless the question explicitly mentions a barangay/city name that is NOT in the allowed list.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS (must satisfy exactly)
A) Total questions: 200
B) City-level: 60
   - At least 10 totals questions for city (Total Investment Program FY 2022 City of Cabuyao)
   - At least 20 line-item fact questions (amount/fund/schedule/etc.)
   - At least 15 aggregation/list questions (top projects by amount, totals by fund source, totals by sector, fund sources exist)
   - Up to 15 unsupported questions (city contractors/procurement/address/etc.)
C) Barangay-level: 110
   - Must cover all 4 barangays with roughly balanced representation (each barangay 20–35 questions)
   - Include at least 20 totals questions across FY 2025/2026 (Total Investment Program per barangay/year)
   - Include at least 60 line-item fact questions across FY 2025/2026
   - Include at least 15 aggregation questions scoped to a barangay
   - Include 15–25 unsupported questions (contractors/procurement/beneficiaries/etc.)
D) Global: 30
   - Include at least 10 compare-years questions (2025 vs 2026 across all barangays)
   - Include at least 8 aggregation questions (top projects, sector totals, fund totals, fund sources exist)
   - Include 5–8 unsupported global questions (e.g., corruption, procurement across all, beneficiary counts)

STYLE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUESTIONS
- Questions must sound natural and realistic for either a citizen or an LGU official.
- Vary phrasing: “How much…”, “What is…”, “Show me…”, “List…”, “Compare…”
- For line-item facts, include either:
  - a project title-like phrase (e.g., “Road Concreting”, “Construction of Barangay Hall”, “Honoraria”),
  - OR an explicit Ref-code placeholder format like “Ref 8000-003-002-006”.
  If you use a Ref code, it must match pattern ####-###-###-###.
  You may reuse a small set of realistic ref codes across multiple questions; uniqueness not required.
- Do NOT invent ultra-specific fields not in AIP (street names, contractor company names) unless the question is UNSUPPORTED.

ID REQUIREMENTS
- IDs must be sequential from Q0001 to Q0200 with zero padding.

FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Output exactly 200 JSON lines.
- No blank lines.
- No trailing commas.
- All strings must be valid JSON strings.
