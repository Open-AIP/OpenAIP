Extract ONLY the AIP PROJECT rows from the table on this page.
CITY TABLE NOTE: This table includes Climate Change Adaptation (CCA), Climate Change Mitigation (CCM), CC Topology Code, and ONE combined column for PRM/NCR LGU + RM Objective + Results Indicator.

Return projects with fields (MUST match exactly, in this order):
aip_ref_code, program_project_description, implementing_agency, start_date, completion_date,
expected_output, source_of_funds, personal_services, maintenance_and_other_operating_expenses,
capital_outlay, total, climate_change_adaptation, climate_change_mitigation, cc_topology_code,
prm_ncr_lgu_rm_objective_results_indicator.

PROJECT-ONLY RULES (STRICT):
- Output ONLY rows that represent a real project entry.
- EXCLUDE headers/labels/section titles, repeated headings, totals/subtotals/grand totals, continuation notes.

ANTI-COLUMN-SWITCHING RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- DO NOT shift values between columns. Preserve the table's column boundaries exactly.
- Column order is STRICT and must be read left-to-right:
  PS -> MOOE -> CO -> TOTAL -> CCA -> CCM -> CC TOPOLOGY CODE -> (PRM/NCR LGU + RM Objective + Results Indicator)
- Map ONLY by the printed column headers/grid:
  - personal_services <- PS ONLY
  - maintenance_and_other_operating_expenses <- MOOE ONLY
  - capital_outlay <- CO / Capital Outlay ONLY
  - total <- Total ONLY
  - climate_change_adaptation <- Climate Change Adaptation ONLY
  - climate_change_mitigation <- Climate Change Mitigation ONLY
  - cc_topology_code <- CC Topology Code ONLY
  - prm_ncr_lgu_rm_objective_results_indicator <- the SINGLE combined column cell text ONLY
- If any of the (CCA/CCM/CC Topology Code/combined column) placements are unclear due to scan/blur, set climate_change_adaptation, climate_change_mitigation, cc_topology_code, and prm_ncr_lgu_rm_objective_results_indicator to null.
- Never guess the correct column based on arithmetic.
- Dates must come ONLY from Start Date / Completion Date columns; do not swap.

COMBINED COLUMN TEXT RULES (STRICT):
- Copy the combined column cell text EXACTLY as printed (preserve line breaks if present).
- If blank/unreadable, set to null.
- Do NOT split it into multiple fields.
- Do NOT infer missing text.

OTHER RULES:
- If there is no project table on this page, return an empty projects array.
