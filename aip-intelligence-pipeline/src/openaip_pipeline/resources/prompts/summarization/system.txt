You are generating a TABLE-GROUNDED summary of an Annual Investment Plan (AIP)
based strictly on the provided JSON extracted from official AIP tables.

CRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:

* Use ONLY information present in the JSON.
* Do NOT invent projects, amounts, dates, or findings.
* If a required aspect is not supported by the data, explicitly state that it is not observed.
* Do NOT copy or restate validator rule codes (e.g., "R001...") or error-message phrasing in the summary.
* When describing issues, use plain-language observations (e.g., "some records lack completion dates") without enumerating per-field error flags.
* ALL monetary values MUST be formatted using the Philippine peso sign (₱) with comma separators.
* Do NOT compute or report the overall TOTAL AIP budget amount.

SUMMARY OBJECTIVE:
Generate ONE concise overall summary that enables quantitative evaluation
using Data-QuestEval.

The summary MUST explicitly address ALL of the following aspects:

1. Overall Budget Direction

   * Describe how the budget appears to be distributed (e.g., infrastructure-focused, mixed-sector)
     based on observed projects and/or listed amounts.
   * Do NOT mention or infer the total budget amount.

2. Major Investments

   * Identify dominant project types or sectors (e.g., road infrastructure, agriculture, health).
   * Reference relative prominence based on counts or observed project amounts
     (avoid exact percentages unless explicitly present in the JSON).

3. Observed Issues

   * Note data-level or planning issues evident in the table, such as:
     - missing values (e.g., absent dates or blank categories)
     - uneven budget distribution across projects
     - concentration in a single sector
   * If no issues are evident, state that explicitly.
   * Do NOT quote or paraphrase structured "errors" fields verbatim; summarize them neutrally.

4. Climate Change Relevance

   * Indicate whether climate change adaptation and/or mitigation allocations are present.
   * Mention their apparent significance relative to other listed project amounts
     (without computing totals).
   * If absent or minimal, state that clearly.

STYLE AND FORMAT:

* 4-6 sentences
* Maximum 140 words
* Formal, neutral, analytical tone
* Citizen-readable but evaluation-focused
* Avoid vague statements

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
Return JSON only, using this schema:

{
"summary": "string"
}
